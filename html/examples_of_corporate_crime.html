      <h4>The Trump Organization</h4>
        <img src="../images/trump-hotel.jpg" width="300" height="175">
        <p class="w3-text w3-text-dark-grey w3-padding-16">
            The Trump Organization's involvement with corporate crime dates back to the 1970's. Since its foundation, it
            has been accused of just about every type of corporate crime imaginable.
            The organization owned apartment complexes and gained a reputation for only renting housing out to white
            people. On top of this, a 2016 analysis found that over 60 different lawsuits have been filed against the
            organization for violating
            workers compensation. Perhaps the biggest offenders within the Trump Organization are the hotels and casinos
            that operate under them. After many failed business ventures that resulted in bankruptcy, Trump took several
            of his businesses
            overseas to places such as Russia, India, and Indonesia. He found real-estate partners in these countries
            and many of them have been caught up in unique corruption charges of their own.
            <br>
            The Trump Organization has also been at the center of many conflicts of interest. Since becoming POTUS,
            there have been countless reports of Trump mixing his personal and political interests and using his
            position for personal gain.
            One such instance of a conflict of interest is the cost of his frequent personal trips to Mar-a-Lago. Recent
            estimates suggest that since becoming president, these trips have cost taxpayers over $64 million. Another
            example of a conflict of
            interest is that an analysis on members of the Trump-owned golf clubs included at 21 trade group officials
            and lobbyists and 50 company executives whose businesses have federal contracts. USA Today claimed that "for
            the first time in U.S.
            history, wealthy people with interests before the government have a chance for close and confidential access
            to the president as a result of payments that enrich him personally".

        <h4>Wells Fargo</h4>
        <img src="../images/wells-fargo.jpg" width="300" height="175">
        <p class="w3-text w3-text-dark-grey w3-padding-16">
            Wells Fargo has been at the forefront of corporate crime since a 2016 scandal that revealed thousands of
            Wells Fargo employees had created millions of checking and savings accounts along with credit cards that
            were never authorized.
            Deeper investigation suggests that this is just one in a long line of crimes Wells Fargo has been accused
            of. In August of last year, the New York Times reported that more than 800,000 people who took out car loans
            from the bank were
            charged for auto insurance they did not need, resulting in roughly 274,000 customers being forced into
            delinquency and almost 25,000 wrongful vehicle repossessions. Wells Fargo has also been accused of targeting
            racial minority groups
            for high interest loans, as well as racially discriminating when handling foreclosures.

        <h4>Amazon</h4>
        <img src="../images/amazon.jpg" width="300" height="175">
        <p class="w3-text w3-text-dark-grey w3-padding-16">
            Amazon.com continues to grow into its role of being America's first source of any goods. It currently
            captures almost half of the money Americans spend online. However, over the past few years, Amazon has been
            entangled in a multitude of labor
            rights issues. It has been dealing with lawsuits, picketing, grueling work conditions, and complaints of
            management tactics and lower wages. Amazon has also been accused of failing to convert to renewable energy
            sources and currently powers
            operations almost solely through the brining of fossil fuels. The company has been in the headlines recently
            for classifying roughly 40 percent of its workers as contractors in order to pay them less.
            One such example is company drivers that have filed a proposed class-action lawsuit in federal court in
            October in Seattle, alleging the company violated federal labor law by classifying them as contractors
            rather than employees.
            Additionally, Amazon is involved in a labor dispute with employees at its warehouses in Germany over pay and
            work conditions. According to a report by USA Today, "Amazon pays its warehouse employees 15% less on
            average than the
            prevailing wage of other warehouse workers in the same region, and it is experimenting widely with ways,
            such as temporary and on-demand employment, to erode job security". This impact is felt beyond Amazon, as
            the growth of Amazon is
            upending the retail industry, which accounts for one out of every eight jobs in the USA. Amazon eliminated
            about 149,000 more jobs in retail than it has created in its warehouses.
