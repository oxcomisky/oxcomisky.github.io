      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">
          Corporate fraud consists of activities undertaken by an individual or company that are done in a
          dishonest or illegal manner, and are designed to give an advantage to the perpetrating individual or
          company. Corporate fraud schemes go beyond the scope of an employee's stated position, and are marked by
          their complexity and economic impact on the business, other employees and outside parties.

          Under the Consumer Protection Act 2007, advertising is seen as misleading if it involves false,
          misleading or deceptive information that is likely to cause the average consumer to act in a way they
          might otherwise not. Advertising may also be considered misleading if important information that the
          average consumer needs to make an informed decision is left out. Misleading advertising covers claims
          made directly to consumers by manufacturers, distributors and retailers, as well as in advertisements,
          catalogues, websites etc.

      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">
          Commercial bribery is a form of bribery which involves corrupt dealing with the agents or employees of
          potential buyers to secure an advantage over business competitors. It is a form of corruption which
          does not necessarily involve government personnel or facilities. One common type of commercial bribery
          is the kickback. For example, a seller of goods or services from "Company A" who offers the purchasing
          manager of "Company B" a payment to his own account to help him secure a contract for Company B's
          continued business is engaging in a form of commercial bribery. Other related offenses are payola in the
          entertainment industry, match fixing in sports, corruption of labor union officials, and bid rigging in
          non-governmental contracts.

      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">
          Embezzlement occurs when someone steals or misappropriates money or property from an employer, business
          partner, or another person who trusted the embezzler with the asset. Embezzlement is different from
          fraud or larceny (theft). The embezzler has permission to handle the property in a certain way (but not
          to take it). Instead, the wrongdoer uses the position of trust granted by the owner to convert the
          property to the embezzlerâ€™s possession and control (to take it).

      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">
          Manipulation is the act of artificially inflating or deflating the price of a security or otherwise
          influencing the behavior of the market for personal gain. Manipulation is illegal in most cases, but it
          can be difficult for regulators and other authorities to detect. Manipulation is also difficult for the
          manipulator as the size and number of participants in a market increases. It is much easier to
          manipulate the share price of smaller companies, such as penny stocks, because they are not as closely
          watched by analysts and other market participants as the medium and large cap firms. Manipulation is
          variously called price manipulation, stock manipulation and market manipulation.
